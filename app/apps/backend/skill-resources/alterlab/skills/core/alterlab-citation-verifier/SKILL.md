# Citation Verifier — Existence-Verify a Bibliography Against Public Scholarly APIs

The headline existence-verification skill: given a bibliography in any common
form, it proves entry-by-entry whether each reference **actually exists** by
querying four keyless public scholarly APIs, then maps each result to the
canonical AlterLab citation-hallucination taxonomy. It is the deterministic,
network-grounded companion to the LLM-driven `integrity_verification_agent` —
where that agent uses WebSearch + judgment, this skill uses authoritative API
records and a reproducible Python script, so the same input always yields the
same verdicts.

## Quick Start

```
Verify the citations in references.bib
Check whether these DOIs resolve to the papers I cited
Audit my bibliography for fabricated / hallucinated references
Does this reference list contain any fake citations or retractions?
```

→ Run `scripts/verify_citations.py` over the bibliography, read the JSON, then
present a verdict table grouped by severity. Always state the offline/degraded
status explicitly if the network was unavailable.

---

## WHAT This Does

For each bibliography entry the script:

1. **Parses** the input (auto-detects BibTeX / DOI-list / free-form), extracting
   title, authors, year, venue, DOI, and arXiv ID.
2. **Resolves identifiers** — looks up the cited DOI/arXiv ID directly when present.
3. **Searches by title** as a fallback across all four sources.
4. **Fuzzy-matches** the cited title (difflib `SequenceMatcher` ratio, default
   threshold **0.70**) and computes author-surname overlap.
5. **Flags retractions** marked in Crossref (`update-to: retraction`) or OpenAlex
   (`is_retracted`).
6. **Emits a verdict** per entry mapped to the taxonomy below, plus a repo-level
   `summary.verdict` (PASS / PASS_WITH_CONDITIONS / FAIL / UNVERIFIED).

### The four sources (all keyless, polite-pool)

| Source | Endpoint | Used for |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Crossref | `api.crossref.org/works` | DOI resolution, metadata, **retraction flag** |
| OpenAlex | `api.openalex.org/works` | DOI + title search, **`is_retracted`** |
| Semantic Scholar | `api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1` | DOI/arXiv resolution, title search |
| arXiv | `export.arxiv.org/api/query` | arXiv ID resolution, preprint title search |

All requests carry a `mailto` parameter (defaults to `alterlab.ieu@gmail.com`)
to stay in each API's polite pool. **No API keys are required or used.**

## WHEN To Use It (and when not)

| Use this skill | Use something else |
|----------------|--------------------|
| "Verify / check / audit my citations or references exist" | Writing the paper → `alterlab-paper-writer` |
| "Did the AI hallucinate any of these references?" | Full integrity gate inside a pipeline → `alterlab-research-pipeline` Stage 2.5/4.5 |
| "Do these DOIs resolve to the papers I cited?" | Grading source quality / predatory journals → `alterlab-deep-research` `source_verification_agent` |
| "Check this bibliography for retractions" | Whether a claim is *supported* by its source (SH) → `claim_verification_protocol` (Phase E) |
| Reproducible, scriptable, offline-capable existence check | Markdown dead-link audit → `alterlab-link-health` |

This skill answers **"does the cited work exist, and does its identifier point
to it?"** It does **not** read the cited paper's full text, so it cannot by
itself confirm Semantic Hallucination (does the source support the claim?) —
that requires `claim_verification_protocol`. SH is surfaced only as an advisory
flag, never asserted from API metadata alone.

## Verdict Taxonomy (mirrors the canonical Five-Type Taxonomy)

Identical codes and definitions to
`alterlab-research-pipeline/agents/integrity_verification_agent.md`
(GPTZero × NeurIPS 2025; Ansari, 2026). Severity feeds the same
SERIOUS / MEDIUM / MINOR scale used in the Integrity Report schema.

| Code | Name | Severity | Script trigger |
|------|------|----------|----------------|
| `verified` | — (exists, matches) | NONE | Title ratio >= threshold AND author overlap OK AND year consistent in >=1 authoritative source |
| `TF` | Total Fabrication | **SERIOUS** | Found in **no** source; OR cited DOI/arXiv ID did not resolve anywhere and no close title match exists |
| `PAC` | Partial Attribute Corruption | MEDIUM | Entry found but >=1 metadata field disagrees (year mismatch, author overlap < 50%, or title ratio < threshold) |
| `IH` | Identifier Hijacking | **SERIOUS** | Cited DOI/arXiv ID **resolved** (method=id) but the resolved record's title is unrelated (ratio < threshold) |
| `PH` | Placeholder Hallucination | **SERIOUS** | Unresolved template/placeholder (`[CITATION NEEDED]`, `\cite{}`, `et al., YYYY`, `TODO`, `forthcoming`) — caught pre-network |
| `SH` | Semantic Hallucination | **SERIOUS** | Entry resolves but does not support its claim — **advisory only**; requires Phase E to assert |
| `unverified` | — (could not check) | MEDIUM | Offline, or all APIs failed for this entry. **Never treated as passing.** |

A `RETRACTED` flag is attached (and severity bumped to SERIOUS) whenever Crossref
or OpenAlex marks the matched work as retracted, independent of the existence
verdict.

### Repo-level verdict

- **PASS** — every entry `verified`, no SERIOUS/MEDIUM flags.
- **PASS_WITH_CONDITIONS** — only `PAC` / MEDIUM issues (wrong metadata, fixable).
- **FAIL** — any SERIOUS verdict (`TF` / `IH` / `PH` / retraction).
- **UNVERIFIED** — entries are `unverified` and no concrete fabrication was found
  (e.g. fully offline run). This is **not** a pass — re-run with network access.

## Pipeline (how to run it)

### 1. Locate or capture the bibliography

Accept any of: a `.bib` file, a `.txt` list of DOIs/arXiv IDs, a pasted
reference list, or inline text. The script auto-detects the format; override
with `--format bibtex|doi|freeform` if detection is wrong.

### 2. Run the verifier

```bash
uv run python skills/core/alterlab-citation-verifier/scripts/verify_citations.py \
    path/to/references.bib \
    --mailto alterlab.ieu@gmail.com \
    --threshold 0.70 \
    --out citation_report.json
```

- `path/to/references.bib` may also be `-` (stdin) or inline text.
- `--threshold` tunes the fuzzy title-match ratio (0..1; default 0.70).
- `--offline` skips the network and emits `unverified` verdicts deliberately.
- Omit `--out` to print the JSON report to stdout.

The script auto-selects an HTTP backend: it uses `requests` if installed, else
falls back to the Python stdlib (`urllib`) — so it runs with **zero extra
dependencies** in a bare `uv` environment.

### 3. Read the JSON and report

Parse `summary.verdict` and the per-entry `verdict` codes. Present:

1. The **headline verdict** and counts (`verdict_counts`, `severity_counts`).
2. A **table of every non-`verified` entry** with its code, severity, and `detail`.
3. For each `TF` / `IH` / `PH`: quote the cited entry and explain the evidence
   (e.g. "DOI 10.x resolved to an unrelated paper titled '…'").
4. Any `RETRACTED` flags, prominently.
5. If `verdict == UNVERIFIED`: state plainly that nothing was confirmed and relay
   the per-entry `manual_instructions`.

### 4. Route fixes

- `TF` / `PH` → the reference must be removed or replaced; it does not exist.
- `IH` → the DOI/arXiv ID is wrong; find and substitute the correct identifier.
- `PAC` → correct the specific metadata field(s) named in `detail`.
- `RETRACTED` → flag to the author; cite the retraction notice or drop the source.

---

## Graceful Degradation (no network)

Network failures are **never** silently swallowed into a pass:

- A DNS/connection failure raises `NetworkUnavailable`; the entry becomes
  `unverified` with a populated `manual_instructions` field.
- `--offline` forces every networked entry to `unverified` up front (placeholders
  are still caught locally as `PH`).
- The repo-level verdict becomes `UNVERIFIED` (distinct from `PASS`) whenever
  unverified entries exist without any concrete fabrication finding.

When degraded, instruct the user to re-run with connectivity, and fall back to
the LLM-driven `integrity_verification_agent` (WebSearch) for a manual pass.

## Output Shape (excerpt)

```json
{
  "tool": "alterlab-citation-verifier/verify_citations.py",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "summary": {
    "total": 2,
    "verdict": "FAIL",
    "verdict_counts": {"verified": 1, "TF": 1, "PAC": 0, "IH": 0, "PH": 0, "SH": 0, "unverified": 0},
    "severity_counts": {"SERIOUS": 1, "MEDIUM": 0, "MINOR": 0},
    "citation_integrity_score": 0.5,
    "fabrication_risk_score": 0.5,
    "retracted": 0
  },
  "entries": [
    {"ref_id": "walters2023", "verdict": "verified", "severity": "NONE",
     "title_ratio": 1.0, "author_overlap": 1.0, "matches": [{"source": "crossref"}]},
    {"ref_id": "ghostpaper2021", "verdict": "TF", "severity": "SERIOUS",
     "detail": "Cited DOI/arXiv identifier did not resolve in any source..."}
  ]
}
```

`citation_integrity_score` and `fabrication_risk_score` (both 0..1) align with
the Integrity Report schema fields of the same name, so the report can feed
`alterlab-research-pipeline`'s integrity gate directly.

---

## Self-Check Before Reporting

- Did the run reach the network? If `config.http_backend` ran but every entry is
  `unverified`, the network was down — say so; do not imply a pass.
- Are there any `RETRACTED` flags? Surface them even on otherwise-`verified` entries.
- Did any entry score `IH`? Confirm the detail shows an **id-resolved** mismatch,
  not a loose title-search coincidence (the script enforces this distinction).
- Is the headline verdict consistent with the per-entry codes (any SERIOUS → FAIL)?
