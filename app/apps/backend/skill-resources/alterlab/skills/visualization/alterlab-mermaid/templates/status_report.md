# Status Report / Executive Briefing Template

> **Back to [Markdown Style Guide](../references/markdown_style_guide.md)** — Read the style guide first for formatting, citation, and emoji rules.

**Use this template for:** Weekly/monthly status updates, executive briefings, project health reports, quarterly reviews, sprint retrospectives, or any document that updates stakeholders on progress, risks, and decisions needed. Designed to be read in under 5 minutes by someone with decision-making authority.

**Key features:** TL;DR at the top for executives who won't read further, traffic-light health indicators, explicit "decisions needed" section that surfaces blockers, metrics table with trends, and risk register with mitigations.

**Philosophy:** The #1 failure mode of status reports is burying the important stuff in a wall of accomplishments. Lead with what needs attention. If the reader only has 30 seconds, the TL;DR and health summary give them what they need. If they have 5 minutes, the full report answers every follow-up question they'd ask. Never make leadership dig for the thing they need to act on.

---

## How to Use

1. Copy this file for each reporting period
2. Name it by date: `status-2026-02-14.md` or `status-week-07.md`
3. **Fill in the TL;DR first** — if you can't summarize it, you don't understand it yet
4. Be honest about health status — green means green, not "green because I'm optimistic"
5. Add [Mermaid diagrams](../references/mermaid_style_guide.md) for progress timelines, architecture changes, or risk impact flows
