# Source Quality and Prioritization

Quick citation-style reference plus how to prioritize the highest-impact papers. Full formatting rules are in `references/citation_styles.md`.

## Citation Style Quick Reference

Detailed formatting guidelines are in `references/citation_styles.md`. Quick reference:

### APA (7th Edition)
- In-text: (Smith et al., 2023)
- Reference: Smith, J. D., Johnson, M. L., & Williams, K. R. (2023). Title. *Journal*, *22*(4), 301-318. https://doi.org/10.xxx/yyy

### Nature
- In-text: Superscript numbers^1,2^
- Reference: Smith, J. D., Johnson, M. L. & Williams, K. R. Title. *Nat. Rev. Drug Discov.* **22**, 301-318 (2023).

### Vancouver
- In-text: Superscript numbers^1,2^
- Reference: Smith JD, Johnson ML, Williams KR. Title. Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2023;22(4):301-18.

**Always verify citations** with `verify_citations.py` before finalizing.

## Prioritizing High-Impact Papers (CRITICAL)

**Always prioritize influential, highly-cited papers from reputable authors and top venues.** Quality matters more than quantity in literature reviews.

### Citation Count Thresholds

Use citation counts to identify the most impactful papers:

| Paper Age | Citation Threshold | Classification |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 0-3 years | 20+ citations | Noteworthy |
| 0-3 years | 100+ citations | Highly Influential |
| 3-7 years | 100+ citations | Significant |
| 3-7 years | 500+ citations | Landmark Paper |
| 7+ years | 500+ citations | Seminal Work |
| 7+ years | 1000+ citations | Foundational |

### Journal and Venue Tiers

Prioritize papers from higher-tier venues:

- **Tier 1 (Always Prefer):** Nature, Science, Cell, NEJM, Lancet, JAMA, PNAS, Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology
- **Tier 2 (Strong Preference):** High-impact specialized journals (IF>10), top conferences (NeurIPS, ICML for ML/AI)
- **Tier 3 (Include When Relevant):** Respected specialized journals (IF 5-10)
- **Tier 4 (Use Sparingly):** Lower-impact peer-reviewed venues

### Author Reputation Assessment

Prefer papers from:
- **Senior researchers** with high h-index (>40 in established fields)
- **Leading research groups** at recognized institutions (Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Oxford, etc.)
- **Authors with multiple Tier-1 publications** in the relevant field
- **Researchers with recognized expertise** (awards, editorial positions, society fellows)

### Identifying Seminal Papers

For any topic, identify foundational work by:
1. **High citation count** (typically 500+ for papers 5+ years old)
2. **Frequently cited by other included studies** (appears in many reference lists)
3. **Published in Tier-1 venues** (Nature, Science, Cell family)
4. **Written by field pioneers** (often cited as establishing concepts)
