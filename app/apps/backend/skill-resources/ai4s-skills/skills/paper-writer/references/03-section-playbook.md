# Section-by-Section Rewrite Playbook

## Why this exists

Step 3 of the skill is "rewrite each section into research prose". That instruction in one line is too thin: research prose is not just longer prose, it is structured prose with conventions readers expect. This reference gives a per-section playbook with required content, length, structure, citation density, and concrete cross-reference patterns.

## Universal rules

- Every section starts with `\section{Title}\label{sec:slug}`.
- Cross-references between sections use `Section~\ref{sec:slug}` (non-breaking space to avoid line breaks).
- Inline citations: `~\cite{key}` for textual flow, `\citep{key}` if using natbib parenthetical style. The current template uses `[numbers,sort&compress]` so `\cite{}` produces `[3, 7]`-style refs — use it.
- Equations: `\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}` for numbered, `$...$` for inline. Reference with `Eq.~\ref{eq:slug}`.
- Tables and figures: see `04-layout-discipline.md`.
- One topic per paragraph. If a paragraph is doing two things, split it.
- Use first-person plural ("we") consistently. Avoid "the authors".
- Prefer specific over generic verbs: "we patch", "we decompose", "we ablate" — not "we use" or "we apply".

## Abstract — `sections/abstract.tex`

**Length:** 150–250 words. **Citations:** 4–8.

**Structure (one paragraph):**
1. **Domain & motivation** (1 sentence): what the paper is about and why anyone should care.
2. **Status of the field** (1–2 sentences with grouped citations): what's been tried and where it landed.
3. **Tension / unresolved question** (1 sentence): what remains debated or unsolved.
4. **Approach** (1–2 sentences): your contribution at a high level. Name the technical idea.
5. **Headline result** (1 sentence): the strongest concrete claim ("matches X on Y benchmarks while reducing compute by Z%").
6. **Disclosure** (if simulated): one sentence flagging that results are simulated and how to reproduce.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Starting with "In recent years…" — instant downgrade.
- No numbers in the headline result.
- Burying the contribution under generic background.
- Spillover into related work (the abstract is not a tour of the literature).

## Introduction — `sections/introduction.tex`

**Length:** 3–4 paragraphs (~600–900 words). **Citations:** 12–20.

**Structure:**

**Paragraph 1 — Problem frame.** Why is this problem important? Use 2–3 application motivations and 1 quantitative anchor (market size, scale, frequency). Cite classical/foundational references.

**Paragraph 2 — First wave of solutions.** The dominant approach when the field opened up. 4–6 citations grouped thematically, with prose that distinguishes them ("Informer~\cite{...} introduced ProbSparse attention; Autoformer~\cite{...} replaced attention with auto-correlation"; etc.).

**Paragraph 3 — Tension or shift.** The problem with the first wave or the new direction. Cite the rebuttal / follow-on work. This paragraph is where the paper's motivation crystallises.

**Paragraph 4 — Contributions and roadmap.** Three lettered or italicized contributions:

```latex
\emph{First}, we ...
\emph{Second}, we ...
\emph{Third}, we ...

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:related}
reviews related work. Section~\ref{sec:method} develops ...
```

**Anti-patterns:**
- 5+ paragraphs that wander before reaching the contribution.
- No clear contribution list — readers should see "First / Second / Third" or numbered bullets.
- Promising experiments not delivered later.
- Citations that don't differentiate ("Many works have addressed this~\cite{a, b, c, d}").

## Related Work — `sections/related_work.tex`

**Length:** 3–5 themed `\paragraph{}` subsections (~700–1200 words). **Citations:** 30–60 here alone.

**Structure:** Each `\paragraph{Theme.}` covers one slice of the literature, ending with a sentence that locates your work within it.

```latex
\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\paragraph{Classical and recurrent baselines.}
[2–4 sentences with 4–8 citations. End by saying how your work relates.]

\paragraph{Efficient attention for long horizons.}
[Distinct sub-theme. 4–8 citations.]

\paragraph{Decomposition and frequency views.}
[Distinct sub-theme. 4–8 citations.]

\paragraph{Re-examining the role of attention.}
[The contrarian / counter-evidence thread.]

\paragraph{Universal and surveyed views.}
[Foundation models, surveys, taxonomies.]
```

**Themes to consider** (pick 3–5 that suit your topic):
- Classical / pre-deep-learning baselines
- The architectural family the paper extends
- Adjacent / rival paradigms (LSTM vs. Transformer; attention vs. linear)
- Application domain prior art
- Empirical / benchmark studies
- Foundation models / pre-train-and-adapt
- Theoretical analyses
- Surveys

**Anti-patterns:**
- Chronological dump ("In 2017, Vaswani… In 2018, Liu… In 2019…").
- Unstructured wall of `\cite{a,b,c,d,e,f,g}` — cite groups of 2–4 with prose that distinguishes them.
- Failing to position your work — every theme should end with "we follow / extend / depart from".
- Treating Related Work as bibliography vomit. The reader should learn the structure of the field, not just see who exists.

## Method — `sections/method.tex`

**Length:** 4–6 `\paragraph{}` subsections (~600–1200 words). **Citations:** 4–8. **Equations:** ≥ 2 numbered.

**Structure:**

**Paragraph — Problem setup.** Notation. Define inputs ($\mathbf{X}_{1:L} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times C}$), outputs, the loss. Establish symbols you'll reuse.

**Paragraphs — Components.** One paragraph per component of the architecture, each ending with an equation or a precise specification. Examples (adapt to your topic):
- Tokenisation / encoding
- Core attention or alternative
- Decomposition / normalisation / regularisation
- Output head

**Paragraph — Training.** Optimizer, schedule, early-stopping criterion, hyperparameter search budget, hardware. Be specific enough that a reader could replicate.

**Paragraph — Complexity.** Time and memory in big-O for the operations introduced, with concrete numbers for typical settings.

**Equations:** at least 2, numbered. Examples:

```latex
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{z}_n^{(c)} = \mathbf{W}_e\,\mathbf{X}_{nS:nS+P}^{(c)} + \mathbf{p}_n.
  \label{eq:patch}
\end{equation}
```

Reference them: "Eq.~\ref{eq:patch} defines the patch embedding."

**Anti-patterns:**
- Pure prose with no equations — for a methods paper, that's incomplete.
- Equations without reference — if you don't refer to it later, why was it numbered?
- Pseudocode dumped via `algorithm` without prose context.
- Hyperparameter list without justification ("we set $d=128$" with no rationale).
- Vague language: "we train using standard practice". Standard *what* practice? Specify.

## Experimental Setup — `sections/experiment.tex`

**Length:** 4 `\paragraph{}` subsections (~400–700 words). **Citations:** 5–10.

**Structure:**

**Paragraph — Datasets.** Each dataset: name, brief description, scale, train/val/test split. Cite the dataset paper if applicable.

**Paragraph — Baselines.** Group by family (linear, recurrent, vanilla Transformer, efficient Transformer, foundation model). Cite each. Briefly note any baseline you skipped and why.

**Paragraph — Metrics & protocol.** Metrics, seeds, hyperparameter selection budget (must match across all models for fair comparison), hardware, software stack. Cite related protocol-aware surveys if you're following a particular convention.

**Paragraph — Disclosure (if simulated).** Plain statement that the numbers in the next section are simulated, the specific code path used to generate them, and that production runs must replace them.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Skipping seeds / variance ("we report a single run").
- Selectively reporting baselines without justification.
- Unfair budgets (your method gets 100 trials of HPO, baselines get 10).
- Missing hardware spec — readers should be able to estimate compute.

## Results — `sections/results.tex`

**Length:** main comparison + ablation + visual + analysis (~700–1200 words). **Citations:** 5–10.

**Structure:**

**Paragraph — What this section answers.** 2–3 questions you'll answer. Tells the reader what to look for.

**Subsection / paragraph — Main comparison.** Big table with all baselines × all datasets. Use `\begin{table}[!t]` (see `04-layout-discipline.md`). Prose around the table summarises what's interesting (top performer, where the gap is largest, surprises). 5–8 sentences.

**Subsection / paragraph — Ablation.** Smaller table that systematically removes each component. Prose explains which component carries the weight. 4–6 sentences.

**Subsection / paragraph — Visual / qualitative.** A figure that shows what the table can't (per-horizon trend, scaling, attention map, error breakdown). Reference with `\ref{fig:...}`.

**Subsection / paragraph — Caveats / when not to use.** Honest paragraph noting where the method does *not* help (small data, weak periodicity, etc.). This builds trust.

**Tables:** 1–2 in this section. Always with `\begin{table}[!t]`, `booktabs`, caption, label.

**Anti-patterns:**
- "Our method is better." — without saying by how much, on what, against whom.
- Tables without captions or with one-line captions ("Results"). Caption should stand alone.
- Bolding the wrong cells (always **bold the best per row**, not your method by default).
- Hiding the cases where your method loses.

## Conclusion — `sections/conclusion.tex`

**Length:** 2–3 paragraphs (~250–450 words). **Citations:** 4–8.

**Structure:**

**Paragraph — Summary.** What you did, in one paragraph, in different words from the abstract.

**Paragraph — Future work.** 2–3 concrete threads. Each should name the open question and one approach. Cite the relevant work each thread builds on.

**Paragraph — Limitations / honest scope.** What this paper does *not* claim. Which audience or regime it doesn't help. Reviewers respect this; absence of it raises suspicion.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Re-stating the abstract verbatim.
- Vague future work ("future work will explore extensions").
- Never admitting limitations.
- Restating contributions as a bullet list (you already had them in §1).

## Cross-section discipline

When the introduction promises a structure, deliver it:

- Introduction §1.4 says "Section~\ref{sec:related} reviews related work" → the rest of the paper must satisfy it.
- Method introduces $\hat{\mathbf{X}}_{L+1:L+H}$ → Results table column headers should match the same notation.
- Experiment names datasets → Results refers to them by the same names.
- Equations defined in Method are referenced from Results / Conclusion if the analysis depends on them.

A paper that breaks these promises feels disjointed even if every section is individually fine.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Related Work: 30–60 cites; themed `\paragraph{}`; each theme positions the paper.
- [ ] Method: 4–8 cites; ≥ 2 numbered equations; explicit complexity statement.
- [ ] Experiment: 5–10 cites; datasets / baselines / protocol / disclosure.
- [ ] Results: 5–10 cites; main table + ablation + figure; caveat paragraph.
- [ ] Conclusion: 4–8 cites; summary / future / limitations.
- [ ] Notation consistent across sections.
- [ ] First-person plural ("we") throughout.
